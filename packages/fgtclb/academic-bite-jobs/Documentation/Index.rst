The TYPO3 extension Academic Jobs with b-ite displays jobs from the b-Ite
eRecruiting platform embedded in the TYPO3 website. All you need to use it
is the b-ite key, which can usually be read from existing b-Ite job
advertisements in the browser.

The job offers are displayed as tiles, lists and tables. The detailed display
of individual job advertisements is automatically linked to the b-ite platform.
The b-ite key can be entered in the extension plugin. Custom assignment allows
groupings such as appointment procedures, academic staff, non-scientific staff
or training positions to be selected.

Further settings for grouping, sorting, display mode and limiting the job
advertisements are also available in the plugin.

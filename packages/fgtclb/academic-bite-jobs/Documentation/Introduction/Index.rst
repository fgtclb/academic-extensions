What does it do?
================

The TYPO3 extension Academic Jobs with b-ite displays jobs from the b-Ite
eRecruiting platform embedded in the TYPO3 website. All you need to use it
is the b-ite key, which can usually be read from existing b-Ite job
advertisements in the browser.

As part of the bundling of requirements for the FGTCLB Academic Extensions,
the TYPO3 extension "Academic Jobs b-ite" was created, which only requires
the b-ite key to seamlessly display job adverts from the b-ite platform on
a TYPO3 website.

The developed plug-in currently supports different categorisations, which
are read from b-ite, e.g. `appointment procedures`, `academic staff`,
`non-scientific staff` and `training positions`.

List view, tile view and table view are currently available as display modes.
There are also options for grouping and sorting as well as a limit for the
number of job adverts to be displayed.

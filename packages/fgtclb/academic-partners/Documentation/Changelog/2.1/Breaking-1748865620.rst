==============================================================
Breaking: Move translations to their belonging locallang files
==============================================================

Description
===========

As some labels used for the backend were maintained in the locallang files for frontend usage,
these labels were organized accordingly.


Impact
======

Some labels in the backend might not be translated anymore, if a custom translation was only added
to the frontend locallang file.


Affected Installations
======================

Installations with custom translations only added to the frontend locallang files.


Migration
=========

Add the custom translations to the correct locallang files.

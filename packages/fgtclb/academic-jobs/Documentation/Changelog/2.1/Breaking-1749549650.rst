========================================================
Breaking: Removed `tx_academicjobs_domain_model_contact`
========================================================

Description
===========

As the relation between `tx_academicjobs_domain_model_job` and `tx_academicjobs_domain_model_contact`
is 1:1 and there is no reuse of contact records, it does not make sense to have a separate table
and record for these contacts. Therefore the relation was resolved and an upgrade wizard
handles the migration to the new fields in the `tx_academicjobs_domain_model_job`.


Impact
======

The change relates all records of type `tx_academicjobs_domain_model_contact`.


Affected Installations
======================

All installations using the database table `tx_academicjobs_domain_model_contact`.


Migration
=========

A TYPO3 UpgradeWizard `academicJobs_contactRelation` is provided to migrate
contact records from relation to fields directly in the job record.

### BREAKING: Removed partials

Some partials got removed as the templating structure has changed. Those partials include:

`Resources/Private/Partials/Contacts/ContactWidget.html`
`Resources/Private/Partials/Contacts/ContactWidgetAddress.html`

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This extension now reuses the partials of the academic-persons extension.

> [!NOTE]
> The default templating now supports basic bootstrap styling and is semantically optimized
> to also not lack any major accessibility.
